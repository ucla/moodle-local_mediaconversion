* Will convert media files uploaded as a file resource or embedded in a label or
embedded in the description of any activity or resource.
* Will convert media files uploaded as link in activity descriptions.
* Will not convert video files in forum posts, quiz questions, assignments, etc.
We will accept any pull requests that does figure out how to implement
conversion for those areas.
